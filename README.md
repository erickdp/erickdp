## Hi, I'm Erick 👋

I'm a machine learning engineer 🤖 and I'm passionate about creating things so clever that you think it's magic, but in reality it's pure science. I believe in free software because it allows to extend knowledge to everyone. 

Some of the technologies in which I excel correspond to:
* Python 🐍🐍 with frameworks like FastAPI, OpenAI and generative AI APIs.
* Java with SpringBoot 🍃☕ and gradle.
* MongoDB, MySQL, PosteSQL, Neo4J 📊
* Kafka
* ReactJs ⚛️
* Docker

I’m looking to collaborate on projects that implement process automation, streamline business and improve the profitability of companies.
